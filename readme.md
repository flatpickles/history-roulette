History Roulette
================

This is a super basic Chrome extension which loads a random webpage from your browsing history when its action button is clicked. More of a proof-of-concept than a useful app, but a good starting point for further exploration.

I haven't published this to the Chrome Web Store, but it's easy to add in Chrome developer mode if you want to try it out. Clone this repo, check "Developer mode" on [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), click "Load unpacked extension", and then select your history-roulette directory.
