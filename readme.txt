History Roulette is a super basic Chrome extension which loads a random webpage from your browsing history when its action button is clicked. More of a proof-of-concept than a useful app, but a good starting point for further exploration.

I haven't published this to the Chrome Web Store, but it's easy to add in Chrome developer mode if you want to try it out. Clone this repo, check "Developer mode" on chrome://extensions, and then click "Load unpacked extension".
